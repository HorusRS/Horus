# Horus: Kernel-Level Security and Administration Tool

Horus is a cutting-edge open-source tool designed for performing forensic and administrative tasks at the kernel level. Leveraging eBPF, a low-overhead in-kernel virtual machine, and the Rust programming language, Horus empowers you to enhance the security and control of your systems.

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, ensuring the security and integrity of your systems is paramount. Horus stands as a powerful solution, granting you the ability to monitor, analyze, and safeguard your system's behavior by operating at the deepest levels of the kernel.

## Key Features

Horus provides a wide array of features, including:

- **Granular Control:** Block potentially dangerous actions such as tracing programs or executing fileless attacks, some are stupid like running rm -rf . when you are in your home directory (true story

- **Kernel-Level Firewall:** Think of Horus as a firewall for your kernel. It actively protects your system against unauthorized or harmful actions, offering a robust defense mechanism.

To begin using Horus, follow these simple steps:

### Running Horus

1. **kwall:** Use the `kwall` command to start the Horus serverless or full mode.

   ```bash
   kwall run serverless / full
   ```
2. **kcontroller:** Launch the Horus controller with the following command:

   ```bash
   kcontroller run
   ```
3. **ELK Stack:** If needed, you can run the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Conclusion

Horus represents the pinnacle of kernel-level security and administration. By harnessing eBPF and Rust, it empowers you to protect your systems from both malicious attacks and inadvertent mishaps. Welcome to a new era of system security with Horus.
